************************************* This is ReadMe for Word Sense Disambiguation Algorithm **************************************************

The executable file is named as Wordsense.java.

There is one external Jar needs to be imported named jaws-bin.jar which is included in the Assignment package submission.

There is wordnet dictionary which path needs to be set in the main file(Attached in Submission folder for reference).

I have used System.set property to set the file path for dictionary.

for ex:  System.setProperty("wordnet.database.dir", "C:/Users/yjeswani/Downloads/WordNet-3.0/WordNet-3.0/dict");

At the above example, I have extracted dictionary and the path is pointing to ./index.sense file. It needs to be manually set before running the program.

Once the external Jars and dictionary is included, you can execute the program from eclipse. (ctrl+f11). 

The Program has been compiled and executed on Eclipse IDE.

There is a String context: which contains the Input sentence. If needed, you can change the String manually and check the senses for different inputs.
